Priorities:
 1. CoExpression Analysis:
    * ability to compare 2 lists (more stat robust)
    * evaluate workflow (rnaseq and microarray working group) for Dual (Host / Parasite analysis)
    * How would the user interact with this data?  expression profile summaries (like vectorbase) 
    * what would it take to enable the profile similarity question for host/pathogen? 
      ** seems like low hanging fruit
    * Prioritize datasets for various communities

 2.  Effectors: signalling pathways / signal peptides
   * Need to pick representative datasets for benchmarking
   * how to prioritize these?

3. UniDB
   * upgrade to ORTHOMCL to grab data instead of proteome upload
   *
