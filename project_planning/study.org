* what do we currently do for datasets?
** Each component loads a "dataset" (apidb.datasource, sres.externaldatabse, apidbtuning.datasetpresenter)
** Each dataset is required to provide attribution in the dataset presenter xml

* what we currently do for ISA 
** ISA Tab or ISA Simple

* Use Cases
** Cross Silo (sample bases).  
   + connect samples across components.
   + unified store for sample details will solve this
** We still need to maintain existing dataset record.  There are many datasets which are not studies.
   + list related datasets in a table
   + perhaps a graphic which visually shows the ISA design?
   + The bad part of this is if the study was the same for multiple datasets, the info in the dataset record is redundant
** Sample Record or part of investigation record
   + what assays were performed for each sample?
** Investigation Record which will list what?
   + This would show sample details for each study
   + Might be nice to show a graphic (cytoscape?) for each study / sample details
*** How does investigation record help with Networks?
    + 
*** How does investigation record hslp with Host Response?
    +

* Problems
** we have very few studies organized into investigations (high cost to benefit)
** people may have trouble understanding the graph/cytoscape view

* TODO
** Unified Sample Details store
** Curation of ISA like files for all applicable datasets

* Sample Details
Investigation
