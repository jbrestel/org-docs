* Notes
- We are a knowledge Base not a data Archive
* Intro
- Introduce DD Group
- how we interact with other VEuPath teams
- describe the remaining slides


* Example:  RNASeq
** Automated Presentation of Data
*The Data Development team uses the results of workflows to provide meaningful tools and visualizations to end users in automated ways*
*** Searches
- SQL Queries for Within Dataset Searches and templates so each Dataset gets its own searchs
  - Fold Difference (Find genes which are different between samples)
  - Expression Levels / Percentiles (Find genes which have high expression in one or more samples)
*** JBrowse
- Templates are used so Browser Tracks can be added with minimal or zero configuration
  - Each Sample - Coverage
  - Each Dataset - Multi Coverage
  - Intron Junctions
  - Combined RNASeq
*** Visualizations
- R (plotly) visualizations of datasets; For each Gene, each dataset can be visualized individually or via a Transcriptomics Summary


** Extended Functionality
*The Data Development team writes workflow steps and front end automations as needed.  New workflows are using nextflow workflows and containerized software.*
*** Examples:
  - DESeq (pairwise comparisons)
  - JTK_CYCLE (cyclical)
  - profile similarity (time series)



* Example:  Comparative Genomics
** OrthoMCL Workflow
*The Data Development team (MarkH) redesigned the OrthoMCL workflow so each VEuPath organism is now processed and kept in sync with production releases.*
*** Searches
- SQL Query to search for OrthoMCL Groups by Phyletic pattern
*** Transform
- Create highly optimized tables to enable fast searches such as Transforms of Gene Results from one organism to another
*** Infer functional annotation
- Assign EC Numbers where this annotation was missing

** Synteny
*The Data Development team writes workflows and uses the results to provide meaningful tools and visualizations to end users*
*** Nextflow Workflow To process genome pairs in parallel (Syntenic Alignments)
- Schema Development and Loader were made to work with larger genomes and scale for the expected volume of genomes
*** Synteny Views (JBrowse)
- Wrote JBrowse Plugin to visualize syntenic spans and highlight ortholmcl groups (add picture)


* Upcoming Data Types
** DNASeq - New Development
 - ** understand the effects of snps on protein (not one at a time)
 - ** whole genome views


** scRNASeq
- umap, violin plots visualizations
- ** expression profiles of individual cells


** Network Analysis and Visualizations
- wgcna (co expression)
- protein-protein interactions (Y2H)
- better present gene/protein interactions 


** Host Pathogen
- Gene Set enrichment tool
- Enabling profile similarity for multiple datasets
- some overlap with Network analysis... also some additional tools relevant to hpi
