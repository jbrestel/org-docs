* Pathways

** Current Record Page
*** TODO Bug Reactions table doesn't sort as expected when clicking "Gene Count"
    + https://redmine.apidb.org/issues/42346
*** TODO Bug Pathway Enrichment tool Word cloud popup says "GO Enrichment
    + https://redmine.apidb.org/issues/42347
*** Loaded KEGG and BioCyc (LeishCyc and TrypCyc?)
*** Pathway Record pages with ways to paint maps
*** Xrefs to Genes (via EC) and compounds (CHEBI)
*** Enrichment tools
*** Transforms from Genes->Pathway (with highlighting)

** MPMP
*** Is it possible to make a cytoscape rendering with gif images as background and overlay EC nodes?
    + can we create a big node for the gif and overlay enzyme/compound nodes;  none should be draggable
*** is it possible to interact with the gif files more directly than using cytoscape?
*** Should we continue trying to create a xml reproduction of his maps??

** Curation tool for pathways
*** easy option to enable User Comments
    + should do this after discussions with curation team
*** more complicated User Workspace for Pathways
*** After apollo is stable, David wants curation team to get involved in curation of pathways

** Other TODOs
*** Load Reactome (Danielle)
*** Load MPMP (Kathryn)
*** Show Hierarchical Organization of Maps
    + Low hanging fruit (available for MPMP and KEGG; MetaCyc??)
    + https://metacyc.org/META/class-tree?object=Pathways
*** View of all maps on one page (KEGG and Reactome have this)??
    + View from Outer space;  can we integrate Reactome FireworksJS?
*** Improve existing user experience
    + adjust zooming params based on the size of the map?
*** Show Signalling pathways (Reactome && MPMP)
    + are these any different than what we already have?

** Mbio Use Cases
*** show pathway abundance
*** view one map
**** enzyme abundance per species per sample
