  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: clinepi-eda-phase-1-sept
  :END:

- Vizs

  - scatter

    - consider removing smoothedMean option?
    - pass errors during smoothing along to data service

  - 2x2
  - bar

    - should possibly have some agg fxns similar to whats planned for
      line plot?

  - box
  - histogram

    - binning should use the annotated and/or inferred ranges

      - for the subset tab (where we always have the full data set):
        client must compare the annotated min to the inferred min and
        use whichever is smaller. compare the annotated max to the
        inferred max and use whichever is larger. pass the values to the
        distribution endpoint.
      - for the viz tab (where we have a subset):
        [[http://github.com/VEuPathDB/plot.data][plot.data]] must
        compare the annotated min to the min value in hand. if the min
        value in hand is smaller, use the dataset min. compare the
        annotated max to the max value in hand. if the max value in hand
        is larger, use the dataset max.

- facet constraints

  - to be done by limiting total number of panels rather than values per
    individual var

- manually validate request params in plugins

  - scatter should only take trend line options for numeric yaxes
  - histo should only take units if xaxis is date

- profiling w umsp

* clinepi eda phase 2 (Dec?)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: clinepi-eda-phase-2-dec
  :END:

- Vizs

  - map

    - at least one custom viz, for the timeline plot. lots of questions
      here..

  - density

  - rxc

    - still need to get the chi sq stats working

  - line

    - need to decide agg fxns, minimally median
    - need to convince clinepi ppl that a time series plot is a specific
      type of line plot, and we should implement the more general case

- derived vars

  - probably easiest to start w categorical. they:

    - can play in all vizs, through strata var
    - can be made from any var, so all vars play in the derived var game
    - dont require reporting of sample sizes to be reliable and clear

  - numerics should possibly be limited to have all parents be numeric
    and off the same entity (no reductions)
  - not sure if we should allow reductions of reductions?
    transformations probably fine..
  - possible to know for a given derived var fxn that it always produces
    cont numbers for ex? need to know type, shape and units to work in
    plots

- Time colocation.

  - Maybe this is an app? I need to see ex plots/ vizs targeted at
    answering this question..
  - i can imagine an ex box plot w an xaxis like 'positive stool for
    something in sept yes/no' and yvalues representing some zscore in
    december.. if thats the idea those feel like an app rather than some
    special subset/query
  - im having a hard time imagining what story the plots might tell if
    youre looking specifically at a subset like 'positive for something
    and then a drop in some zscore over the next 3 months'

  - [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hR1eGD_7ImaFP3dFWn0VnVkneDo5I0ZdOHCWlEOxN84/edit][Mock-ups]]

- plot.data

  - needs to support continuous overlay vars, at least for scatter
  - needs to return stats for boxplot groups
  - needs scatter and box to take list of vars as a var

- Apps/ computations (still need draft apis, and a compute service..)

  - beta-div

    - dissimilarity matrix (various methods, dont remember currently)
    - ordination (pcoa)

  - alpha-div

    - one computation for all methods (shannon, simpson, eveness, etc)
      to be cached together

  - rel-abund

    - user selected 10 taxa
    - top ten taxa (median, mean, variance, etc)

- Vizs (still need draft apis)

  - rel-abund/boxplot

    - list of vars as a var (for the taxa) on xaxis
    - all else is standard boxplot

  - rel-abund/scatterplot

    - list of vars as a var (taxa) as overlay
    - all else is standard scatterplot

  - alpha-div/boxplot

    - alpha div metric on yaxis
    - all else is standard boxplot

  - alpha-div/scatterplot

    - alpha div metric on yaxis
    - all else is standard scatterplot

  - beta-div/scatterplot

    - pcoa dimensions 1 and 2 as axes.
    - need to make stats indicating accommodated variance visible on
      plot
    - gradient color scale for continuous vars
    - no trend lines
    - no facets

  - beta-div/boxplot

    - dissimilarity matrix values on yaxis
    - all else standard boxplot

- think all apps and vizs need to list projects they are valid for?

  - mbio and clinepi both want pass app, but mbio doesnt want 2x2 for ex
  - clinepi wont want the mbio specific apps

- merge service

  - needs to learn how to merge assays by taxon, similar to clinepis
    need to merge by time

* genomics eda (Dec?, ive no clue when really)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: genomics-eda-dec-ive-no-clue-when-really
  :END:

- general thoughts

  - maybe genes play into vizs similarly to the taxa in mbio, where you
    can make a list of genes as a var
  - then merge service can merge across assays by gene id, again similar
    to mbio?
  - does this come to unidb too?
  - does this need cross-study?
  - can probably use the pass app, maybe correlation
  - additional apps/vizs might be:

    - tsne, pathway maps w cytoscape, umap, dedicated heatmap and violin
      vizs (need spec'ing, ill try to get jb and mark to tell me more)
    - Anything that helps pick out one or a few genes of potential
      interest may be framed as a compute in eda. mbio rel abundance app
      as ex..

* mbio eda phase 2 (??)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: mbio-eda-phase-2
  :END:

- Apps/ computations (needs spec'ing yet)

  - differential abundance
  - correlation

* dataplotter (??)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: dataplotter
  :END:

- thumbnail svgs

  - specify height and width in presenter
  - defaults in injector(s)
  - injector passes values to both dataplotter and the model text
    attribute

- kill perl cgi-script in favor of the eda style infra

  - impacts genomics mostly, but also clinepi. mbio has request for
    similar plots in results pages to clinepi
  - maybe phased

    - start w clinepi (mbio can come along i guess)
    - then transcription summary
    - various tables on gene record page, order undecided yet

  - need to figure how to capture all the configurations that are either
    injected or hard coded in perl and R code
  - [[http://plot.data][plot.data]] needed for some plots, others maybe
    just a bit of reformatting of raw data to meet api

    - this to me implies the data service, or a service very like it, w
      plugins which can decide to use java or R as needed.

  - data service? might be nice to keep all vizs in one place

    - could be a new app?
    - plug-able data store?

  - do we want to revisit how the data are stored in the db at the same
    time? i remember some frustrations while switching data plotter to
    use a java service to supply data, dont remember details.

* clinepi eda phase 3 (??)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: clinepi-eda-phase-3
  :END:

- vizs (all need spec'ing, underlying plot components dont yet exist)

  - heatmaps

    - many ways to configure one of these, need to decide what well
      allow and how to make var constraints to match

  - violin plot

    - dont even know how to implement violin plots w pre-computed values
      in plotly.. custom trace?

  - correlogram

    - most likely implemented using heatmap web component, so should
      keep this in mind when spec'ing heatmap

** my dreams (never, probably.. who has the time??)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: my-dreams-never-probably..-who-has-the-time
   :END:

- vizs rather than tables on results pages

  - theyd be unique to the question asked. theres a lot of quality data
    in there that could be easier to digest
  - stand alone, representing the data in the existing table, rather
    than plots as entries in the table..

- make prettier, more complex and informative pathway record pages

  - there are concepts in reactome that we cant currently represent
    well, or at all
  - maybe mbio or genomics eda will prioritize pathways and drag
    genomics records along w it?

- get more familiar/ comfortable w the web-components and web-eda repos

  - where will vizs that dont belong to eda live?
  - what all hands contribute to making these wo crc guys?

- eda

  - cross-study specific vizs, to support proper meta-analyses w
    weighted values based on the dataset
  - cross-component specific vizs, should it come to unidb for ex
  - does this eventually get on board w the 2 month release cycle?
  - Finding datasets to work w in eda? based on the data types and
    values etc?

- ortho

  - there must be vizs there i dont know about, or vizs it needs and
    doesnt have?
  - there is at least one network graphic using cytoscape

    - maybe should look at if/when i get to pathway records. if we
      decide to have a general network graph plot component for ex..
