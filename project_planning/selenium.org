** TODO Bindu will discuss with JohnI and Anna how to do regression test for install GUS/ApiDB/ApiDBTuning from empty instance (daily? weekly?)
** TODO JBrowse test for unique track names
** TODO JBrowse test for no weird characters in track names
** TODO JBrowse test for dataset wdkreference match the model (union or component site?)

** TODO run selenium in jenkins! need container for browser


** TODO Strand specific RNASeq should test the average coverage of sense/antisense
** TODO RNASeq regression tests?  how to run these each release.
     + Run after patches and rebuilds
** TODO Changes to RNASeq regression tests so they can be run on a single db each release
** TODO integratin into jenkins
** TODO run headless and incorporate into jenkins
** TODO 43163 (new test for dataset)
** TODO JBRowse keys unique in json
** TODO meeting with other developers who are interested to write one
** TODO test for site search matches record count.  need wdk search with returns all records
* Types of Tests
** Smoke Tests
- Basic test like "is the application is running"
- I believe our integration sites are a form of smoke test.
- This could be enhanced as we used to have by trying to load the home page or the default gene page or any pages we want

** End to End testing
- manual QA sessions into this category
- other manually written tests

** Regression tests
- JUnit or TestNG
- Page Object Model (separate out the code which navigates the page from the tests)

- Selenium can use HTMLUnit driver (headless browser) and integrated into Jenkins;
  - No Javascript when headless
- End to End Testing possible with Chrome/Firefox drivers
- Selenium IDE is a chrome/firefox plugin which records browser interaction

** SQL Performance Testing
- SQL performance (can we capture consistent gets for queries we write?)

** Unit Tests for new code where appropriate
- ebi2gus would have been a good candidate
- installGUS and apidb schema into Empty instance
- JohnI has this already in Jenkins i believe
- run a min workflow to create a sandbox instance
- MarkH has done this

* Implementation
** HTMLUnit
- Test response code
- json or xml pages
** Selenium / TestNG
*** Headless builit into Jenkins
*** Standalone with eclipse with browser of your choice (Chrome,Firefix,...)
- Start by running tests for reporting from eclipse
- we don't want the integration/qa sites breaking all the time.
