* How to choose datasets?
  + which datasets / how many do we have which qualify for wgcna? 
  + there are ~ 9 in plasmo which qualify
  + configuration can be done manually

* Workflow
  + power calculation.  need to manually set in analysisConfig.xml
  + iterative wgcna
  + insert study results (new result table [na_feature_id, protocol_app_node_id (eigengene), correlation_coeefficient)

* Single Dataset (1st Deliverable)
1. given a gene source_id && experiment && correlation, return the other genes in that same module
   ++ graph gene and input gene on profile like we do for similarity
2. Plot gene of interest and all other genes in the module
3. Use wgcna module as input to Gene set overabundance tool
4. on gene page, transcriptomics section add a link to the search to find other genes in the same module
