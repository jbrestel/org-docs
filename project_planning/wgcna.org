* UniDB how to associate datasets which are common on RNASeq/Microarray Internal page?

* Existing Similarity Search
  + make a UniDB website
  + in UniDB context ... make this search run on multiple datasets (Host/Pathogen)
  + 


* WGCNA

** how to choose datasets?
  + which datasets / how many do we have which qualify for wgcna? 
  + there are ~ 9 in plasmo which qualify
  + configuration can be done manually

** Workflow
  + power calculation
  + iterative wgcna
  + insert study results (new result table [na_feature_id, protocol_app_node_id (eigengene), correlation_coeefficient)

** Single Dataset
   + Gene set overabundance tool.. can stil return one row per "dataset" also need to identify which module/eigengene was enriched
   + **First Deliverable** given a gene source_id && experiment && correlation, return the other genes in that same module
     ++ graph gene and input gene on profile like we do for similarity
   + on gene page, transcriptomics section add a link to the search to find other genes in the same module
