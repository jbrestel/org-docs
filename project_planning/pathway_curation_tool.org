Curation Tool For Pathways

What we need to allow people to do
 * Create new nodes
 * Create new edges
 * add few attributes to the node (is reversible for edge)
 

Implementation

 1. Cytoscape Desktop
    - Let anyone download json, upload to cytoscape desktop, modify and submit
    - cytoscape desktop too general.  Too hard to make changes.  
    - Only Curators can submit for official data load

 2. Cytoscape JS
    Leverage User Datasets
      - Button on Pathway record page ("Modify this Pathway and Save") which would create a User Dataset
      - We get for free Login protection and list of pathway user datasets
    a. Test Instance we can create a Pathway UserDataset
      ** 
    b. new cytoscape js gui 
       - could test out curator tool on new page or pathway record page
    c. requires Steve's group to create UserDataset from Pathway Page
    d. allow anyone to submit but how to integrate??
       ** one option is like "user comment model" where we just show alternative views in a table on the pathway page
          ** Use this for KEGG pathways
       ** another is to have a curator look at all submissions and deterimine which should be integrated
          ** someone like Hagaii could make changes to his pathways
    e. do we need to build in all "painting options" into the user dataset page? or can we import user's version into the pathway record page?
    *** JohnB will make mock ups present in UX
