* Use Cases
** ClinEpi
   + per dataset and cross study
   + record for each entity type with all attributes
   + User Data (Jay)
** Microbiome
   + per dataset and cross study
   + Sample record with tables for sample details and OTU
** Genomics
   + cross organism (effectively cross study)
   + Sample Record with tables for sample details
** MapVEu
   + query across all studies

* Plugins
** InsertEntityGraph
   + ApiDB.Study
   + ApiDB.EntityType
   + ApiDB.ProcessType
   + ApiDB.EntityAttributes
   + ApiDB.ProcessAttributes
   + ApiDB.AttributeUnit
   + ApiDB.ProcessTypeComponent
** LoadAttributesFromEntityGraph
   + ApiDB.Attribute
   + ApiDB.AttributeValue
** LoadEntityTypeAndAttributeGraphs
   + ApiDB.AttributeGraph
   + ApiDB.EntityTypeGraph
** LoadDatasetSpecificEntityGraph (for eda workspace)
   + ApiDB.AttributeValue_${studyId}_${EntityTypeId}
   + ApiDB.AttributeGraph_${studyId}_${EntityTypeId}
   + ApiDB.Ancestors_${studyId}_${EntityTypeId}
     ++ possibly a problem for x study ??

* Load More Test Data
** TODO SCORE_CrossSect
   + need to incorporate the geohash file into the household file?
   + need to stub in some onotlogyterms for geohash levels
** TODO MALED?

* TODO ClinEpi Production Loading (Jay/Lin/Ontology)
** Each EntityType must be assigned a distinct OntologyTerm (ex.  HouseholdObservations can no longer be the same as parent "Household")
** Units should be handled
   + column headers could be made to specify unit of all values in column
   + would we still do ontology mapping in ontologyMapping.xml for these?
** "multifilter" and "termType" ontology terms need to be included in an owl file
** what is the status of the "ontologyMapping.xml" for mapping variable names?  have we changed to use owl file for this purpose?
   ** may not want to do this;  may slow down loading
** need ontology terms for all geohash levels
** rewrite clinepi workflow to use new plugins
** rewrite clinepi model (records) to use new tables

* How to integrate with Mbio and Genomics Results tables?
** New EntityTypes with Characteristics can be grafted / added directly to "JSON" tables
** New Characteristics to existing nodes can be added to "TALL" (attributevalue/attribute) tables
   + example: mbio otu's
   + example: geohash levels
** Need something like dbxrefs to link records (study/dataset/entities)
** Replace protocol_app_node fk in results tables 
** Genomics workflow sometimes adds edges (Assay->Data) with some characteristics (ex. mapping stats)
   ++ would create a new "ProfileSet" table instead of overloading Study
** Configure each dataset in the workflow instead of processing a big directory

* MapVEu
** Investigation tab has info we need to capture
   + could pull this out into datasetpresenter files?
** Remaining Ontology Work
